GrapHiC
========

GrapHiC is  a  python  library  for  constructing graph representations of Hi-C data and integrating such representations with multi-omics data for  computational  analysis. The  library  interfaces  with  the popular Cooler Hi-C format (although we plan to add functionality for other Hi-C formats in future) and Pytorch Geometric by default. As feature engineering is a vital step in a machine learning project, the library is designed to be highly flexible, allowing the user to parameterise the graph construction, creating lists of subgraphs from sets of genomic regions or by specifying particular genomic loci. GrapHiC is also designed to facilitate network-based and graph-theoretic  analyses  of  protein  structures in  a  high-throughput  manner.
