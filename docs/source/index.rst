Welcome to GrapHiC's documentation!
====================================
This package provides 
    * functionality for producing graph based represenations of 3D chromatin configurations from Hi-C data
    * functionality for integrating 1D epigenetic datatracks with Hi-C graph representations

.. note::
   This is an early-stage project and a lot more documentation and functionality is planned to be included. If you are a structural biologist or machine learning researcher in computational biology, my inbox is always open for suggestions and assistance!
