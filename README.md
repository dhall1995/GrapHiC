# GrapHiC-ML (Graph-based Hi-C Machine Learning)
![alt text](https://github.com/dhall1995/GrapHiC-ML/blob/data/img.png?raw=true)
A selection of scripts to analyse Hi-C contact data through the use of graphical neural networks. 

Proper implementation/creation of the correct pytorch geometric graph datasets requires ChIPseq and DNA methylation data
as well as Hi-C maps. This data has not been publically uploaded yet but has been collected within the Laue and Hendrich
labs in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Cambridge. For enquiries please email: dh486@cam.ac.uk
